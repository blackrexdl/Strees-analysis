<h1 align="center"><u>Stress Analysis System using Python</u></h1>

## 🧠 Project Overview
The **Stress Analysis System** is a Python-based application designed to analyze user-provided text and determine stress levels using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The project focuses on backend logic, machine learning integration, and real-time analysis through a simple web interface.

This application demonstrates how Python can be used to build intelligent systems that process human emotions and textual data efficiently.

## ▶️ How to Run This Project

Follow the steps below to run the project locally on your system:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd StressAnalysis
```

---

### 2️⃣ Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

**On macOS / Linux**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

Install Flask:
```bash
pip install flask
```

If the project uses NLP or machine learning libraries:
```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

(If a `requirements.txt` file is available, run:)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

Start the Flask server:
```bash
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

---

### 5️⃣ Open in Browser

Open your browser and visit:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

---

### 🛑 Stop the Server
Press:
```bash
CTRL + C
```
in the terminal.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user enters text related to their thoughts or emotions.
2. The text is sent to the Python backend using Flask.
3. The machine learning model processes the input.
4. The system predicts the stress level.
5. The result is displayed on the web interface.
